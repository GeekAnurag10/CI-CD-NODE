Node.js Project: Ensure your Node.js application includes a test framework like Jest or Mocha.

Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application:

Kubernetes Cluster:
Use a managed Kubernetes service like GKE, EKS, or AKS, or a self-hosted cluster.
Ensure kubectl is configured locally to access the cluster.

GitHub Repository Secrets:
Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
DOCKER_USERNAME: Docker Hub or other registry username.
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Docker Hub or other registry password.
KUBECONFIG: Base64-encoded kubeconfig file for accessing the Kubernetes cluster.
(Optional) SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: Webhook URL for Slack notifications.

GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file in your repository:

Explanation of the Workflow

on Section:
Runs tests on pull requests targeting the main branch.
Triggers build and deploy on pushes to the main branch.

jobs.test:
Installs dependencies and runs tests to ensure code quality.

jobs.build-and-deploy:
Builds a Docker image, tags it with the commit SHA and latest, and pushes it to Docker Hub.
Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.
Sends success or failure notifications to a Slack webhook.

Kubernetes Deployment File

Ensure you have a Kubernetes deployment manifest (node-app-deployment.yml) to define your application. Example:

Slack Webhook Setup (Optional)
Create a Slack Incoming Webhook.
Add the webhook URL to your repository secrets (SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL).

Testing the Pipeline
Open a pull request and verify that tests run automatically.
Push changes to the main branch and confirm that:
Docker images are built and pushed.
The Kubernetes deployment is updated.
Notifications are sent for success or failure.
